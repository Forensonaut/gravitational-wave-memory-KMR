# Gravitational Wave Memory from Tidal Disruption Events (Kathpalia Memory Relation)

This repository contains a Python simulation for modeling the gravitational-wave memory effect produced by tidal disruption events (TDEs) near primordial black holes, based on the analytic scaling law derived by Tanish Kathpalia (2025).

## How to Run

Install requirements:

pip install numpy matplotlib

Then run:

python kmr_memory_simulation.py

The script will produce a plot of GW memory strain vs PBH mass.
